#  Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations

##  Objective

Analyze monthly **revenue** and **order volume** from a dataset of online sales.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- Python 3.12+
- pandas
- SQLite (via `sqlite3` module)
- VS Code (or any IDE/text editor)

---

## Dataset

The dataset is a CSV file named:  
`Auto Sales data.csv`

It contains the following relevant columns:
- `Order Date`: The date of the order
- `Amount`: Revenue generated by the order
- `Order ID`: Unique identifier for each order

---

##  Process Overview

1. Load CSV using `pandas`.
2. Parse the order date and clean the data.
3. Create a local SQLite database (`sales.db`).
4. Store the cleaned data in a table named `orders`.
5. Use SQL to:
   - Extract **year** and **month** from order dates.
   - Calculate `SUM(amount)` for monthly revenue.
   - Count distinct `order_id` for order volume.
6. Output the result to the console and export to a CSV file:  
   `monthly_sales_trend.csv`

##  SQL Query Used

```sql
SELECT
    strftime('%Y', order_date) AS year,
    strftime('%m', order_date) AS month,
    SUM(amount) AS total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_volume
FROM orders
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month;
